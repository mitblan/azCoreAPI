## Important Note

The AzerothCore Team and Owners DO NOT in any case sponsor nor support illegal public servers. If you use these projects to run an illegal public server and not for testing and learning it is your own personal choice. - [AzerothCore Team](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/home)

With that said and me being in complete agreement. This project is birthed of my desire to get some experience working with legacy databases that I did not create nor can I modify how they are designed. I think this is an important skill to have and givin that the AzCore works off of three databases, all containing information that could easily translate to useful pages on a website. It creates a great oppurtunity to learn.
